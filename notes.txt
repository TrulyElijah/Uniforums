In home.css, I have 15vh for header and 85 vh
for the container. We can remove this or keep it.

- Create account html still needs to be done. Some css reorganization needs to be done
- View profile html is not organized with css either
- 404 page header needs better css styling (navbar does not touch edges)

EJS
-- Need to change ejs a tags from html to just express routing (use /placeToRedirectTo 
instead of ./views/place_to_be_directed.html)
